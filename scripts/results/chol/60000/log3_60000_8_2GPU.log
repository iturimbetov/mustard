Test 1D Laplacian of order 60000
Step 1: Create Mg handle and select devices 
	There are 2 GPUs 
	Device 0, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 1, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
step 2: Enable peer access.
	 Enable peer access from gpu 0 to gpu 1
	 Enable peer access from gpu 1 to gpu 0
Step 3: Allocate host memory A 
Step 4: Prepare 1D Laplacian for A and X = ones(N,NRHS) 
Step 5: Create RHS for reference solution on host B = A*X 
Step 6: Create matrix descriptors for A and D 
Step 7: Allocate distributed matrices A and B 
Step 8: Prepare data on devices 
Step 9: Allocate workspace space 
	Allocate device workspace, lwork = 450027636 
Step 10: Solve A*X = B by POTRF and POTRS
