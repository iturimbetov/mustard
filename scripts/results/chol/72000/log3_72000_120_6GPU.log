Step 3: Allocate host memory A 
Step 4: Prepare 1D Laplacian for A and X = ones(N,NRHS) 
Step 6: Create matrix descriptors for A and D 
Step 7: Allocate distributed matrices A and B 
Step 8: Prepare data on devices 
Step 9: Allocate workspace space 
	Allocate device workspace, lwork = 43200204 
Step 10: Solve A*X = B by POTRF and POTRS
