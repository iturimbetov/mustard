Test 1D Laplacian of order 60000
Step 1: Create Mg handle and select devices 
	There are 6 GPUs 
	Device 0, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 1, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 2, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 3, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 4, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 5, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0

	 Enable peer access from gpu 5 to gpu 1
	 Enable peer access from gpu 5 to gpu 2
	 Enable peer access from gpu 5 to gpu 3
	 Enable peer access from gpu 5 to gpu 4
Step 3: Allocate host memory A 
Step 4: Prepare 1D Laplacian 
Step 5: Create matrix descriptors for A and B 
Step 6: Allocate distributed matrices A and D 
Step 7: Prepare data on devices 
Step 8: Allocate workspace space 
	Allocate device workspace, lwork = 390400 
Step 9: Solve A*X = B by GETRF and GETRS
