[starpu][_starpu_history_based_job_expected_perf] Warning: model starpu_dlu_lu_model_11_openblas is not calibrated enough for cuda0_impl0 (Comb0) size 128000000 footprint 40ccae41 (only 0 measurements), forcing calibration for this run. Use the STARPU_CALIBRATE environment variable to control this. You probably need to run again to continue calibrating the model, until this warning disappears.
