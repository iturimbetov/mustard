Test 1D Laplacian of order 12000
Step 1: Create Mg handle and select devices 
	There are 2 GPUs 
	Device 0, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
	Device 1, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, cc 8.0 
step 2: Enable peer access.
	 Enable peer access from gpu 0 to gpu 1
	 Enable peer access from gpu 1 to gpu 0
Step 3: Allocate host memory A 
Step 4: Prepare 1D Laplacian 
Step 5: Create matrix descriptors for A and B 
Step 6: Allocate distributed matrices A and D 
Step 7: Prepare data on devices 
Step 8: Allocate workspace space 
	Allocate device workspace, lwork = 86400 
Step 9: Solve A*X = B by GETRF and GETRS
